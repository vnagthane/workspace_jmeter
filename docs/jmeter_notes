Apache JMeter v5.4.2

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install Java 8+ and set path , javahome in env variables
Install Git
Download Pluignsmanager.jar and place it in lib/ext
launch JMeter/bin/jmeter.bat

create repo in GitHub
create workspace directory in local
open command prompt and run git clone <httpurlofrepo.git>
git status
git config --global user.email "vinayaknagthane@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "vnagthane"
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin master
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Practice :
Use JMeter in CLI mode while running LT
Take backup of script before deleting irreverent elements from the recorded script.

JMeter Test plan is file XML in the form of tree view

Test plan is root element in JMeter
we can't delete it from file.

Threads : define the workload
eg ramp up , ramp down threads


Frequently used elements/components in JMeter :

Config elements : define certain details such as : Config, auth, user defined variables etc.

Listener : visualize the test results also for debugging purpose.

Timer : define the delay between the requests
eg. constant timer, Random timers

Preprocessor : perform certain actions before sending the sampler

Postprocessor : process the response and manipulate

Assertions : define checkpoint, response code, tags,

Test Fragment : works along with module controller

Non Test element : define recording controller  or create mirror server.

Thread Group > Samplers :
Sampler is critical element in JMeter , it's used to send request
Eg. HTTP Request, Debug sampler, JSR223 , Flow Control action,

Logic Controller : Helps to control business flow.

We can add the above elements to TP

Starting point of Test Plan(TP) is Thread Group(TG) .
We can add multiple TG.


3 Different Ways to develop JMeter Script for Web Application :
a. Build in JMeter recorder
b. Using 3rd Party browser plugins
c. By manually adding elements to test plan

to test FTP/SMTP , DB we need to add elements manually to TP
configure and debug and make the script ready.

Prerequisites :
* Know how of the Application , Functionality
* Business flow
* Test data

JMeter Recording Prerequisites
* Set the proxy to capture traffic from internet

Windows > Proxy Settings > Manual Proxy Setup : localhost 8888 > Save

JMeter > TP > TG > Non Test Element > HTTP(s) Test script recorder : to set the proxy in jemter

Using built in Test script recorder it will capture lots of irreverent traffic/requests/calls
so to avoid them we need to do some House keeping work to make our TP efficient.

After creating TP we can disable/ delete the non test script elements such as - HTTP(s) test recorder
and to quickly validate add  Listener "View Results Tree" for debugging to see request and response.


In corporate Network we need to make sure we have to handle proxy username and pwd while launching the browser.

* Verify status code, contents in webpage for response

Steps :
Configure Script recorder
Make sure port is avaiable at 8888
Go to Windows Proxy , Change the settings to 8888
Launch browser

When recording started we need to launch new browser session
then it will capture the requests.


* Blazemeter : Chrome extension
It can record the business flow using the browser and export to JMX format.
without changing the Windows proxy and it will also reduce the house keeping work i.e. it will
not capture the irreverent requests.

Once filling all details , refresh the page to record the requests.



Drawback : need to create Blazemeter account

Provide details in plugin for recording such as :
User agent/browser , Filter Pattern for exclusion of requests.

Advance options

After recording we can export the file to JSON, JMX, Taurous or Run the recorded script in cloud (free tier)

# HTTP Request Sampler  : most used sampler in JMeter

HTTP Request Method is only mandatory parameter in HTTP request sampler.














Q : Does in RT do we prefer Blazemeter plugin for recording?
